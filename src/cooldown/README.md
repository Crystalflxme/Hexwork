# Cooldown
A module designed to manage cooldowns of any type. It uses a key based system for managing individual cooldowns under a given Cooldown object. Calculations to determine if a cooldown is active are only done when you actually need to check if a key is on a cooldown. Using `wait()` or yielding is avoided to provide performant results.

## Example

This is an example of how to utilize Cooldown:
```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local cooldown = Cooldown.new(5) -- Create a new cooldown of 5 seconds

part.Touched:Connect(function(hit)
	local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(hit.Parent)
	if not player then
		return
	end
	
	cooldown:DoTask(player, function(onCooldown, timeLeft)
		if onCooldown then
			timeLeft = math.floor(timeLeft * 10) / 10 -- Format the time
			print("There are", timeLeft, "second(s) left!")
		else
			print("Activated!")
		end
	end)
end)
```
This will print "Activated!" whenever you touch "part" only every 5 seconds.
